# Urlaubsplaner - The Smart Vacation Planner

![Urlaubsplaner Logo](Server/wwwroot/images/logo.png)

**Maximize your time off! This intelligent vacation planner helps you find the optimal vacation periods by cleverly utilizing public holidays and bridge days ("Br√ºckentage").**

This application is designed for users in Germany, providing a powerful tool to visualize and plan vacations for the entire year. It fetches data for public holidays and school holidays, calculates the best opportunities to use your vacation days, and presents everything in an intuitive, interactive calendar.

*(Note: A live demo or a screenshot of the application would be great here!)*
